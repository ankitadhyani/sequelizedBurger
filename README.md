# Sequelized-Burger App


This project lets the user:
    1. Add a burger to the list (and store in DB).
    2. If burger is consumed then it can be moved to "Devoured" list.
    3. A burger can also be moved back into ready to consume list if new burgers of same type are ready.

This app mainly uses sequilize to execute RESTful APIs.



## Technologies used

This is a burger store application built with Node, Express, Sequilize and MySQL.
